      We collected our data through targeted Google searches—using keywords like 
      “Campus Community Connections projects,” “UN Sustainable Development Goals datasets,” 
      and “UMD Grand Challenges project listings.” We chose these sources to ensure a broad,
      relevant set of projects and goals for integration and visualization.
